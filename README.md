## Project Description

This project was designed to build my first professional portfolio.  This portfolio will begin to be a showcase of my progress thoughout my time at the Penn Boot Camp as well as other professional achievements I am looking to highlight.  Although not currently lush in content, my expectations are to have this portfolio filled with many dynamic examples of code and applications for you all to review.
